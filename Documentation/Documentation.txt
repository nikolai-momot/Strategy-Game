=======================================================================
Summary:
We created strategy game that pits two to five AI player against each other.The players - starting with a base, two units and some money - must use their intellect to conquer nearby towns, 
recruit units and defeat the other players. The game is designed in such a way that a new map can be created in minutes: dragging a base prefab onto the map adds a player to the game, 
extra objectives(cities, towns, etc) can be added by placing their respected prefabs on the game map. 

Implemented by Nikolai:

Heat Map - By toggling with the H key you can display the threat given off by the players, represented by a gradient from yellow to orange to red

PathFinding - The map is devided into a grid of cells, invisible to the observer, that the AI use to navigate to where they want to go using an A* search algorithm

Implemented by Ryan:

Central Architecture - 
The core game mechanics, the Players, GameManager, Strategic Objective class & children, etc.

There are alot of things which aren't used for this AI demo, alot of code is in place to further develop this into a playable game.
Everything from the ForceComp down in hierarchy is not relevant for the AI, it is in place for the future.

The goal of the game is to take the Other player's bases. If it's a 1v1, the player simply needs to take the other's base.
If there are multiple players, the player who first owns all of the bases wins.

note: the actual balance and function of the game its self was put secondary to the AI decision making.
As a result, the game can't be won. It seems to end with the winning player choosing to repeatedly pummel weakened enemy armies.
Since it can't take the base...

Decision Making - 
Each player is represented by a Player_AI class. 
This class controls the given armies, collects and spends money, recruits units for armies and town garrisons etc.
Preliminary Influence Map usage: Armies retreat away from a battle in the direction that has the least heat,
resulting in them moving away from Danger in the best path they can.
